# Advent Of Code 2022

## Introduction

This project contains all of my solutions for the Advent of Code 2022 puzzle set (www.adventofcode.com) combined into a single project alongside my personalised input data. The entire project has been written in F# and is targeting a functional first approach, trying to minimise mutable values or side effects.

This code is all solely my own work, and you can reference or use it to whatever extent it may be of use for you to do so. This is done entirely at your own risk as I make no claims this code is best practice, efficient, or stable outside of the limited scope of calculating my AoC answers.

## Structure

The executable entry point is in the MainProgram.fs file. This file contains the user input loop which allows the User to specify which days results are to be calculated and displayed. The calculations for each day are contained in separate source files, one for each day.

The input data is kept in the repository, with the pathing to this data handled by a routine in the MainProgram file. It is currently set up relative to the project folder so the project should build and run in Visual Studio fine.

## Notes on the Puzzles

(Obviously, some spoilers for the puzzle solutions)

	<summary>Day 1</summary>

A straight forward puzzle, nothing much to say really.

	<summary>Day 2</summary>

Not too difficult in principle, but I ended up going down a path of explicitly pattern matching all cases. I feel like there must be a more elegant way of doing this, but this approach is pretty transparant about how it works so still reasonably happy with it.
